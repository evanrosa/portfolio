### Overview

This project explores the **development and optimization of real-time streaming data pipelines** for **soccer match data**, leveraging **Kafka, Apache Flink, and Apache Spark** to process and analyze **high-throughput event streams**. Using **Confluent as the streaming backbone** and Python for API integrations, the system efficiently handles **real-time data ingestion, transformation, and monitoring**. The primary data source is **sports match data** retrieved from the **SportsRadar Soccer API**, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information for event processing.

### Key Contributions

- **Engineered scalable real-time data ingestion pipelines** with **Apache Kafka**, ensuring efficient message queuing and event-driven processing of live soccer match data.
- **Implemented Apache Flink for stream processing**, enabling **low-latency transformations and real-time analytics** on match events, player statistics, and team performance.
- **Optimized distributed computation** using **Apache Spark**, allowing for **batch and real-time data processing within the same pipeline**.
- **Integrated Confluent for centralized streaming management**, improving **workflow observability, fault tolerance, and scalability**.
- **Developed APIs for seamless integration with data sources**, ensuring **efficient data retrieval and transformation** of soccer match statistics.

### Results

- **Enhanced real-time data processing capabilities**, enabling **low-latency ingestion and transformation of live soccer data**.
- **Optimized event-driven workflows**, ensuring **high throughput and minimal processing lag** for sports event tracking.
- **Identified best practices for real-time data pipelines**, including **partitioning strategies, state management, and scalability optimizations**.
