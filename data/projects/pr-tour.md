### Overview

This project focuses on **real-time and historical flight data analytics**, leveraging **Kafka, Apache Flink, and Apache Spark** to process and analyze **air travel patterns** for flights to and from Puerto Rico. Using **public aviation datasets and real-time APIs**, the system ingests **live flight schedules, delays, and weather conditions**, enabling dynamic reporting and trend analysis.

### Key Contributions

- **Built a real-time event-driven architecture** powered by **Apache Kafka**, ensuring **low-latency ingestion of flight schedules, delays, and air traffic statistics**.
- **Developed Flink-based streaming analytics**, enabling **continuous transformation of flight events** to detect anomalies and optimize airline performance insights.
- **Designed a scalable batch analytics workflow** with **Apache Spark**, allowing **historical trend analysis on travel influx, seasonal patterns, and airline reliability**.
- **Orchestrated automated data workflows** using **Apache Airflow**, ensuring **fault-tolerant and scheduled ETL processes for daily reporting**.
- **Implemented interactive dashboards in Superset**, offering **insights into peak travel times, delay patterns, and airport congestion metrics**.

### Results

- **Enhanced visibility into Puerto Rico’s travel ecosystem**, supporting **data-driven decision-making for tourism and transportation stakeholders**.
- **Optimized processing of high-frequency flight data**, ensuring **real-time and batch analytics are seamlessly integrated**.
- **Established a scalable foundation** for **future enhancements**, such as **predictive modeling for flight delays and passenger flow forecasting**.
