### Overview

This project focuses on **real-time and historical subscription analytics**, leveraging **Kafka, Google BigQuery, SQLMesh, and Preset** to process and analyze **customer subscriptions, revenue trends, and churn rates**. Using **event-driven architecture and data modeling**, the system ingests **subscription events, renewals, and cancellations** to enable dynamic reporting and predictive insights.

### Key Contributions

- **Developed a real-time event-driven architecture** powered by **Apache Kafka**, ensuring **low-latency ingestion of subscription events, renewals, and cancellations**.
- **Integrated BigQuery as a scalable data warehouse**, enabling **efficient storage and querying of streaming and batch data for business intelligence**.
- **Implemented SQLMesh for data transformation and modeling**, creating **cleaned, structured datasets optimized for analytics and forecasting**.
- **Automated data ingestion and transformation workflows**, ensuring **seamless updates and real-time metrics without manual intervention**.
- **Designed interactive dashboards in Preset**, offering **insights into revenue trends, churn rates, and customer lifecycle metrics**.

### Results

- **Improved visibility into subscription trends**, supporting **data-driven decision-making for revenue growth and customer retention**.
- **Optimized data processing pipeline**, ensuring **seamless integration of streaming and batch analytics for continuous insights**.
- **Established a scalable foundation** for **future enhancements**, such as **predictive modeling for churn and subscription forecasting**.
