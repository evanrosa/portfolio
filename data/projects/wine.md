### Overview

This project demonstrates the **design and optimization of a data pipeline** for analyzing and predicting **wine review ratings**. Using **Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn**, I built a structured workflow that preprocesses, transforms, and models wine review data to derive meaningful insights.

### Key Contributions

- **Developed a scalable ETL pipeline** to ingest, clean, and structure wine review datasets for machine learning applications.
- **Applied advanced data preprocessing techniques**, including handling missing values, feature encoding, and outlier detection.
- **Implemented predictive models** such as **Random Forest and Linear Regression** to analyze correlations between price, region, and rating.
- **Optimized model performance** using **hyperparameter tuning**, reducing errors and improving prediction accuracy.
- **Evaluated and visualized model outputs**, providing actionable insights into wine review trends and pricing strategies.

### Results

- **Achieved an RMSE of 2.3**, demonstrating high accuracy in predicting wine review ratings.
- **Created a reusable data pipeline**, ensuring consistent preprocessing and transformation of new datasets.
- **Derived insights into consumer wine preferences**, offering potential applications for recommendation systems in the wine industry.
