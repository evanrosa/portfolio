### Overview

This project showcases the development of a **data pipeline and machine learning models** aimed at predicting outcomes of English Premier League (EPL) matches. The workflow includes **web scraping** for data collection, **data preprocessing**, and the application of **predictive modeling** techniques to forecast match results.

### Key Contributions

- **Data Collection:** Implemented web scraping scripts to gather historical EPL match data, including team statistics, player information, and match outcomes.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and structured the scraped data, handling missing values, normalizing data formats, and creating relevant features for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Developed new features such as team form, head-to-head statistics, and player performance metrics to enhance model accuracy.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Applied machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifiers, to predict match outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and fine-tuned models through hyperparameter optimization.

### Results

- **Prediction Accuracy:** Achieved a notable accuracy in predicting match outcomes, demonstrating the effectiveness of the data pipeline and modeling approach.
- **Insights:** Identified key factors influencing match results, such as team form and player statistics, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of EPL matches.
