### Overview

This project showcases a **scalable and automated ETL pipeline** for processing **AAPL stock market data**, leveraging **Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, and MinIO**. The system efficiently orchestrates, transforms, and stores financial data, demonstrating expertise in **data engineering workflows, pipeline automation, and real-time data processing**.

### Key Contributions

- **Orchestrated ETL workflows** using **Apache Airflow**, ensuring efficient scheduling, monitoring, and execution of data tasks.
- **Developed high-performance data transformations** with **Apache Spark**, converting **raw JSON stock data into structured formats like Parquet and CSV** for analytical use.
- **Integrated MinIO as an object storage solution**, enabling **scalable, fault-tolerant, and secure storage** of processed financial data.
- **Optimized data processing efficiency**, reducing **latency and ensuring near real-time data availability**.
- **Ensured data pipeline reliability**, implementing **logging, monitoring, and error handling mechanisms** to maintain system stability.

### Results

- **Automated the entire stock market ETL workflow**, minimizing manual intervention and improving operational efficiency.
- **Enhanced data accessibility** by structuring stock market data in a **query-optimized format**, improving analytics and decision-making.
- **Enabled real-time financial data processing**, making stock data immediately available for reporting and machine learning applications.
